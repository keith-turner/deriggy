Deriggy
-------

A simple prototype library, built on [Apache Fluo][fluo], that maintains a
derived graph created from multiple raw graphs.  As the raw graphs change, the
derived graph is updated.  For an example of this library in action, see the
[Mixer] project.

The API entry point for this library is [Deriggy][Deriggy.java].
